/**
 * The standard render pipeline for a Panels display object.
 *
 * Given a fully-loaded panels_display object, this class will turn its
 * combination of layout, panes, and styles into HTML, invoking caching
 * appropriately along the way. Interacting with the renderer externally is
 * very simple - just pass it the display object and call the render() method:
 *
 * @code
 *   // given that $display is a fully loaded Panels display object
 *   $renderer = panels_get_renderer_handler('standard', $display)
 *   $html_output = $renderer->render();
 * @endcode
 *
 * Internally, the render pipeline is divided into two phases, prepare and
 * render:
 *   - The prepare phase transforms the skeletal data on the provided
 *     display object into a structure that is expected by the render phase.
 *     It is divided into a series of discrete sub-methods and operates
 *     primarily by passing parameters, all with the intention of making
 *     subclassing easier.
 *   - The render phase relies primarily on data stored in the renderer object's
 *     properties, presumably set in the prepare phase. It iterates through the
 *     rendering of each pane, pane styling, placement in panel regions, region
 *     styling, and finally the arrangement of rendered regions in the layout.
 *     Caching, if in use, is triggered per pane, or on the entire display.
 *
 * In short: prepare builds conf, render renders conf. Subclasses should respect
 * this separation of responsibilities by adhering to these loose guidelines,
 * given a loaded display object:
 *   - If your renderer needs to modify the datastructure representing what is
 *     to be rendered (panes and their conf, styles, caching, etc.), it should
 *     use the prepare phase.
 *   - If your renderer needs to modify the manner in which that renderable
 *     datastructure data is rendered, it should use the render phase.
 *
 * In the vast majority of use cases, this standard renderer will be sufficient
 * and need not be switched out/subclassed; style and/or layout plugins can
 * accommodate nearly every use case. If you think you might need a custom
 * renderer, consider the following criteria/examples:
 *   - Some additional markup needs to be added to EVERY SINGLE panel.
 *   - Given a full display object, just render one pane.
 *   - Show a Panels admin interface.
 *
 * The system is almost functionally identical to the old procedural approach,
 * with some exceptions (@see panels_renderer_legacy for details). The approach
 * here differs primarily in its friendliness to tweaking in subclasses.

   * hardcoding none of its output), but for most regions no style has been

   *  - If a region has had its style explicitly set, then we fetch that plugin

   *  - If the region has no explicit style, but a style was set at the display
   *    level, then inherit the style from the display.
   *  - If neither the region nor the dispay have explicitly set styles, then
   *    fall back to the hardcoded 'default' style, a very minimal style.
   *
   * The other important task accomplished by this method is ensuring that even
   * regions without any panes are still properly prepared for the rendering
   * process. This is essential because the way Panels loads display objects
   * (@see panels_load_displays) results only in a list of regions that
   * contain panes - not necessarily all the regions defined by the layout
   * plugin, which can only be determined by asking the plugin at runtime. This

   * ensuring none are inadvertently skipped.
