    <p>We can use access plugins to determine access to a page or visibility of the panes in a page. Basically, we just determine access based on configuration settings and the various contexts that are available to us.</p>
<p>The arbitrary example in plugins/access/arg_length.inc determines access based on the length of the simplecontext argument. You can configure whether access should be granted if the simplecontext argument is greater or less than some number.</p>
