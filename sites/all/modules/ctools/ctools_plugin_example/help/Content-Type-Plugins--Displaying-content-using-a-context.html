    <p>Now we get to the heart of the matter: Building a content type plugin. A content type plugin uses the contexts available to it to display something. plugins/content_types/simplecontext_content_type.inc does this work for us.</p>
<p>Note that our content type also has an edit form which can be used to configure its behavior. This settings form is accessed through the panels interface, and it's up to you what the settings mean to the code and the generation of content in the display rendering.</p>
