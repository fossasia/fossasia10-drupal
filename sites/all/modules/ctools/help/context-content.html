<p>The CTools pluggable content system provides various pieces of
content as discrete bits of data that can be added to other
applications, such as Panels or Dashboard via the UI. Whatever the
content is added to stores the configuration for that individual piece
of content, and provides this to the content.</p>

<p>Each content type plugin will be contained in a .inc file, with
subsidiary files, if necessary, in or near the same directory. Each
content type consists of some information and one or more subtypes,
which all use the same renderer. Subtypes are considered to be
instances of the type. For example, the 'views' content type would have
each view in the system as a subtype. Many content types will have
exactly one subtype.</p>

<p>Because the content and forms can be provided via ajax, the plugin
also provides a list of CSS and JavaScript information that should be available
on whatever page the content or forms may be AJAXed onto.</p>

<p>For the purposes of selecting content from the UI, each content
subtype will have the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A title</li>

  <li>A short description</li>

  <li>A category [Do we want to add hierarchy categories? Do we want
  category to be more than just a string?]</li>

  <li>An icon [do we want multiple icons? This becomes a hefty
  requirement]</li>
</ul>

<p>Each piece of content provides one or more configuration forms, if
necessary, and the system that includes the content will handle the
data storage. These forms can be provided in sequence as wizards or as
extra forms that can be accessed through advanced administration.</p>

<p>The plugin for a content type should contain:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>title</dt>

  <dd>For use on the content permissions screen.</dd>

  <dt>content types</dt>

  <dd>Either an array of content type definitions, or a callback that
  will return content type definitions. This callback will get the
  plugin definition as an argument.</dd>

  <dt>content type</dt>

  <dd>[Optional] Provide a single content type definition. This is only
  necessary if content types might be intensive.</dd>

  <dt>render callback</dt>

  <dd>
    The callback to render the content. Parameters:

    <dl>
      <dt>$subtype</dt>

      <dd>The name of the subtype being rendered. NOT the loaded
      subtype data.</dd>

      <dt>$conf</dt>

      <dd>The stored configuration for the content.</dd>

      <dt>$args</dt>

      <dd>Any arguments passed.</dd>

      <dt>$context</dt>

      <dd>An array of contexts requested by the required contexts and
      assigned by the configuration step.</dd>

      <dt>$incoming_content</dt>

      <dd>Any 'incoming content' if this is a wrapper.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>

  <dt>admin title</dt>

  <dd>A callback to provide the administrative title. If it is not a
  function, then it will be counted as a string to use as the admin
  title.</dd>

  <dt>admin info</dt>

  <dd>A callback to provide administrative information about the
  content, to be displayed when manipulating the content. It should
  contain a summary of configuration.</dd>

  <dt>edit form</dt>

  <dd>
    Either a single form ID or an array of forms *keyed* by form ID
    with the value to be used as the title of the form. %title me be
    used as a placeholder for the administrative title if necessary.
    Example:
    <pre>
  array(
    'ctools_example_content_form_second' =&gt; t('Configure first form'),
    'ctools_example_content_form_first' =&gt; t('Configure second form'),
  ),
</pre>The first form will always have required configuration added to
it. These forms are normal FAPI forms, but you do not need to provide
buttons, these will be added by the form wizard.
  </dd>

  <dt>add form</dt>

  <dd>[Optional] If different from the edit forms, provide them here in
  the same manner. Also may be set to FALSE to not have an add
  form.</dd>

  <dt>css</dt>

  <dd>A file or array of CSS files that are necessary for the
  content.</dd>

  <dt>js</dt>

  <dd>A file or array of javascript files that are necessary for the
  content to be displayed.</dd>

  <dt>admin css</dt>

  <dd>A file or array of CSS files that are necessary for the
  forms.</dd>

  <dt>admin js</dt>

  <dd>A file or array of JavaScript files that are necessary for the
  forms.</dd>

  <dt>extra forms</dt>

  <dd>An array of form information to handle extra administrative
  forms.</dd>

  <dt>no title override</dt>

  <dd>Set to TRUE if the title cannot be overridden.</dd>

  <dt>single</dt>

  <dd>Set to TRUE if this content provides exactly one subtype.</dd>

  <dt>render last</dt>

  <dd>Set to true if for some reason this content needs to render after
  other content. This is primarily used for forms to ensure that render
  order is correct.</dd>
</dl>

<p>TODO: many of the above callbacks can be assumed based upon
patterns: modulename + '_' + name + '_' + function. i.e, render,
admin_title, admin_info, etc.</p>

<p>TODO: Some kind of simple access control to easily filter out
content.</p>

<p>The subtype definition should contain:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>title</dt>

  <dd>The title of the subtype.</dd>

  <dt>icon</dt>

  <dd>The icon to display for the subtype.</dd>

  <dt>path</dt>

  <dd>The path for the icon if it is not in the same directory as the
  plugin.</dd>

  <dt>description</dt>

  <dd>The short description of the subtype, to be used when selecting
  it in the UI.</dd>

  <dt>category</dt>

  <dd>Either a text string for the category, or an array of the text
  string followed by the category weight.</dd>

  <dt>required context [Optional]</dt>

  <dd>Either a ctools_context_required or ctools_context_optional or
  array of contexts for this content. If omitted, no contexts are
  used.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Rendered content</h3>

<p>Rendered content is a little more than just HTML.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>title</dt>

  <dd>The safe to render title of the content.</dd>

  <dt>content</dt>

  <dd>The safe to render HTML content.</dd>

  <dt>links</dt>

  <dd>An array of links associated with the content suitable for
  theme('links').</dd>

  <dt>more</dt>

  <dd>An optional 'more' link (destination only)</dd>

  <dt>admin_links</dt>

  <dd>Administrative links associated with the content, suitable for
  theme('links').</dd>

  <dt>feeds</dt>

  <dd>An array of feed icons or links associated with the content. Each
  member of the array is rendered HTML.</dd>

  <dt>type</dt>

  <dd>The content type.</dd>

  <dt>subtype</dt>

  <dd>The content subtype. These two may be used together as
  module-delta for block style rendering.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Todo: example</h3>

<p>Todo after implementations are updated to new version.</p>
