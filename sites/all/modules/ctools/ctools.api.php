/**
 * This hook is used to inform the CTools plugin system about the location of a
 * directory that should be searched for files containing plugins of a
 * particular type. CTools invokes this same hook for all plugins, using the
 * two passed parameters to indicate the specific type of plugin for which it
 * is searching.
 *
 * The $plugin_type parameter is self-explanatory - it is the string name of the
 * plugin type (e.g., Panels' 'layouts' or 'styles'). The $owner parameter is
 * necessary because CTools internally namespaces plugins by the module that
 * owns them. This is an extension of Drupal best practices on avoiding global
 * namespace pollution by prepending your module name to all its functions.
 * Consequently, it is possible for two different modules to create a plugin
 * type with exactly the same name and have them operate in harmony. In fact,
 * this system renders it impossible for modules to encroach on other modules'
 * plugin namespaces.
 *
 * Given this namespacing, it is important that implementations of this hook
 * check BOTH the $owner and $plugin_type parameters before returning a path.
 * If your module does not implement plugins for the requested module/plugin
 * combination, it is safe to return nothing at all (or NULL). As a convenience,
 * it is also safe to return a path that does not exist for plugins your module
 * does not implement - see form 2 for a use case.
 *
 * Note that modules implementing a plugin also must implement this hook to
 * instruct CTools as to the location of the plugins. See form 3 for a use case.
 *
 * The conventional structure to return is "plugins/$plugin_type" - that is, a
 * 'plugins' subdirectory in your main module directory, with individual
 * directories contained therein named for the plugin type they contain.
 *
 * @param string $owner
 *   The system name of the module owning the plugin type for which a base
 *   directory location is being requested.
 * @param string $plugin_type
 *   The name of the plugin type for which a base directory is being requested.
 * @return string
 *   The path where CTools' plugin system should search for plugin files,
 *   relative to your module's root. Omit leading and trailing slashes.

function hook_ctools_plugin_directory($owner, $plugin_type) {

  // and 'styles' plugins but no 'cache' or 'display_renderers', it is OK to be
  // lazy and return a directory for a plugin you don't actually implement (so
  // long as that directory doesn't exist). This lets you avoid ugly in_array()
  // logic in your conditional, and also makes it easy to add plugins of those
  // types later without having to change this hook implementation.
