    README.txt for logintoboggan.module for Drupal
*******************************************************

This module was co-developed by Jeff Robbins (jjeff) and Chad Phillips (thehunmonkgroup) with several features added by Raven Brooks (rbrooks00).

The Login Toboggan module improves the Drupal login system in an external module by offering the following features:

   1. Allow users to login using either their username OR their email address.
   2. Allow users to login immediately.
   3. Provide a login form on Access Denied pages for non-logged-in (anonymous) users.
   4. The module provides two login block options: One uses JavaScript to display the form within the block immediately upon clicking "log in". The other brings the user to a separate page, but returns the user to their original page upon login.
   5. Customize the registration form with two e-mail fields to ensure accuracy.
   6. Optionally redirect the user to a specific page when using the 'immediate login' feature.
   7. Optionally redirect the user to a specific page upon validation of their e-mail address.
   8. Optionally display a user message indicating a successful login.
   9. Optionally have unvalidated users purged from the system at a pre-defined interval
      (please read the CAVEATS section of INSTALL.txt for important information on configuring
      this feature!).

Users who choose their own password can be automatically assigned to a selected 'non-authenticated' role. This role could have more permissions than anonymous but less than authenticated - thus preventing spoof accounts and spammers. The user will only be removed from the non-authenticated role and granted authenticated permissions when they verify their account via a special email link, or when an administrator removes them from the non-authenticated role.

The module does NOT require any patches to core or other special configurations.
