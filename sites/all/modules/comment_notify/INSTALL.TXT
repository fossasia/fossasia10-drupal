5. Set your node-notify settings per user (optional)

their nodes. To enable this go to "My account" > Edit (e.g. user/1/edit)

OPTIONAL MODULES
----------------

Performance: If you notice that your site is very slow when submitting
new comments it is possible that the problem is with sending the mails. 
One option is to use the Queue Mail module
http://drupal.org/project/queue_mail

COMPATIBILITY NOTE
------------------------ 
Comment Notify is not built to work
on sites where other mail related modules are installed (modules like Actions,
Notify, Subscriptions, and Organic Groups are popular examples). If you install
both Comment Notify and one of these other mail modules on your site in addition
to Comment Notify it may send duplicate messages and/or have user interface
elements that will appear to be duplicates and confuse your site visitors.

The suggested configuration in these instances is to separate Comment Notify and
whatever other mail module you have installed. Common ways to separate them are
by content type or user permissions.
