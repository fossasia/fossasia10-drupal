CONFIGURING AND USING
---------------------
1. Go to admin/build/block

2. Ensure that 'Language switcher' block is associated with a visible region. If
   unsure move the 'Language switcher' block to 'Left sidebar' region.

3. Click on 'Save' button.

4. To preview simply view any appropriate page. If successful you will see a
   flag on the left side of each language link.

There are some configuration options at admin/settings/language/icons. You can
place flags before or after the language link or choose to only display the
language flag without the language name (pick "Replace link" under icon
placement to do so). There are some other options so make sure to check it out.
